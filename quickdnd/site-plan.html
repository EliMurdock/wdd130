      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Good online resources for Dungeons and Dragons can be hard to find. The best sites typically lock parts of the material behind a paywall, making it hard for the average player to find the needed information, especially for character building. Do players want better, free resources and character builders? Absolutely, and this is why I am designing a site to help players with just that! It will have the basic resources needed for character creation, allowing for an easy reference to all the material in the official D&D books. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The primary audience for this site will be my friends, and possibly acquaintances as well. All the people I share this site with will either have an interest in playing dnd or be actively playing. Most of them will be college-age as I am. This site is meant to be a reference site, so the average user should not stay for very long unless actively copying information from the site, as most of the information is meant to be used at the game table.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

        Welcome to the Quick DND site! This site is designed to help you through the difficult choices that come during character creation. The three basics of character creation, as well as the most important choices you'll make during it, are which race, class, and background your character will have. To help with that, I've compiled the resources below to serve as an easy reference when comparing the different options you have! To start, scroll down and view the races below. Write your choice of race on your character sheet before progressing to the next page. Do the same for each page and voila! You now have a character framework, ready to go for your next DND session.
