    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose this site will serve is to share information 
      and opinions about rafting and other outdoor activities.
      It will not be a comprehensive list, but rather a quick 
      and easy list, mostly useable by those who would know me 
      and take my reccomendations.</p>
    <!-- purpose complete -->

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>My target audience is primarily my friends, although classmates, 
      teachers, and family are also welcome to view. These people need 
      information primarily for amusement, but they may find some of 
      the things on the website useful if they are planning on going 
      river rafting or another rexburg outdoor activity anytime soon.
      Thier river rafting needs are not currently being met. This site 
      will primarily be accessed on desktop by those planning or 
      interested in outdoor activities</p>

    <h2>Style Guide</h2>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
    <p>Palette URL:</p>
    <a href="https://coolors.co/0b3c49-82a3a1-a9714b-82ff9e-231123"
      target="_blank">https://coolors.co/0b3c49-82a3a1-a9714b-82ff9e-231123</a>

    <table class="colors">
      <tr>
        <th>Primary</th>
        <th>Secondary</th>
        <th>Accent 1</th>
        <th>Accent 2</th>
      </tr>
      <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
      <tr>
        <td class="primary">0B3C49</td>
        <td class="secondary">A9714B</td>
